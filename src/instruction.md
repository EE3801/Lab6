## Some extra tips to make your life easier (optional but recommended)
*contact Huy at `quanghuy@u.nus.edu` or catch him during tutorial / lab if you have any problems installing any of these softwares.*

#### Starship

When you see:

```shell
[some path here] 
$
```

The thing above is known as the prompt, it is where you enter your command and send to your shell. The area immediate to the right of the `$` is known as the command-line. You can read more about it [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line/). 

The default prompt as you can see is a bit lackluster and hard to read. This is where [Starship](https://starship.rs/) shines. Starship is a custom prompt (aesthetic wise with some extra functionalities) to help you style and allows your prompt to provide more useful information about your shell operation. You can also install it for the AWS server linux instance.

You can follow the website instruction on how to install it and feel the difference yourself. Trust me you won't regret it!

#### Alacritty

If you find your terminal a tad bit too slow or just doesnt feel nice to use. I would recommend installing this terminal emulator called [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) instead. It is a really fast and responsive terminal, so you won't second doubting yourself whether it is the terminal that is slow or that you have typed in something wrong. Now you can be sure that it is probably your fault =)).
