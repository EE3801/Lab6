# Part 1. Updating files from GitHub

## 1.
We will need to generate some additional data from your cluster, so first create a cluster from your EC2 instance.

## 2.
You will need to get the new versions of a few files in the `PyHipp` repository, so you can rename the following scripts you created in Lab 6 (remember to do `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`) and merge with the upstream repository to get the versions in the upstream repository:

```shell
consol_jobs.sh               rs2a-slurm.sh
envlist.py                   rs3a-slurm.sh
pipe2a.sh                    rs4a-slurm.sh
rpllfp-slurm.sh              rse-slurm.sh
rplhighpass-sort-slurm.sh    sort-slurm.sh
rs1a-slurm.sh
```

If merging with the upstream changes worked, when you list the files in the `PyHipp/PyHipp` directory according to modification time, you should see the following files have been modified recently:

```shell
freqspectrum.py
misc.py
waveform.py
```

Remember to push to your repository after merging to make sure you have a backup of your code in your repository on GitHub.

## 3.
If you would like to use a snapshot with completed data from Lab 7, you can delete your current cluster, make a copy of the following snapshot: `snap-0b457c8f46fc9e13a`, edit the `cluster-config.yaml` file on your EC2 instance to use the Snapshot ID of your copy, and then create a new cluster. Once you have your new cluster ready, you will have to copy your AWS credentials and your key pair from your EC2 instance to the `/data` directory again, as well as clone your `PyHipp` repository to `/data/src/PyHipp` again.
