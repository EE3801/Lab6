# Part 2. Generating cumulative objects in iPython

## 4.
We will now create a series of objects that can be used to visualize the data in iPython using one of the compute nodes (refer to instructions in Part 6 - Step 36 in Lab 5):

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@compute-dy-i32xlarge-1 ~]
$ cd /data/picasso

(env1) [ec2-user@compute-dy-i32xlarge-1 picasso]
$ ipython
```

## 5.
We will first append all the saved Unity objects together in iPython so we can plot them together. 

```shell
In [ ]: import PyHipp as pyh
In [ ]: import DataProcessingTools as DPT
In [ ]: uyall = DPT.objects.processDirs(dirs=None, objtype=pyh.Unity)
In [ ]: uyall.save()
```

In this case, `processDirs` is used to go through all the subdirectories to find Unity objects and adds them together to return a cumulative object `uyall`, which is an object that contains data from multiple sessions.

## 6.
Next, we will create `Waveform` objects, which show the results of the spike sorting, in each channel directory, and append them together:

```shell
In [ ]: wfall = DPT.objects.processDirs(dirs=None, exclude=['*eye*', '*mountains*'], objtype=pyh.Waveform, saveLevel=1)
In [ ]: wfall.save()
```

The exclude argument used above tells `processDirs` to skip directories with names that contain `eye` and `mountains`. 

You can quit iPython and logout of the compute node once the cumulative object has been saved.

## 7.
You can now transfer the cumulative objects to your computer by doing the following on your computer to get the IP address of your head node:

> <p class="note"> Note
>
> Windows users, please do this specific step (transfer of files) through WSL.

```shell
(aws) 
$ cd ~/Documents

(aws) 
$ mkdir picasso

(aws) 
$ pcluster describe-cluster --region ap-southeast-1 --cluster-name MyCluster01
```

You can use the IP address to copy the files (which combined are around 486 MB) to your computer (the `-p` flag in `scp` preserves the creation times of the files you are transferring):

```shell
(aws) 
$ scp -i ~/MyKeyPair.pem -p "ec2-user@54.251.188.19:/data/picasso/unity*.hkl" picasso/

(aws) 
$ scp -i ~/MyKeyPair.pem -p "ec2-user@54.251.188.19:/data/picasso/waveform*.hkl" picasso/
```
