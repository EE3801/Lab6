Apply for an account [here](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/hpc/get-an-hpc-account/) (you will need to be on the NUS network or use WebVPN)

You can enter the following responses when prompted:

> **NUS email for Supervisor**: shihcheng@nus.edu.sg
> 
> **Reason for using HPC resources**: To process large data sets in parallel
> 
> **List the Software that you intend to use**: Python
> 
> **Research Domain**: Data engineering
> 
> **Research Objectives and Methodology**: To learn how to use PBS to submit jobs to the HPC queues
>
> **Relevance**: To learn tools used for data engineering
> 

It might take a few minutes for you to receive an email stating that your request has been approved, so you might want to read through these documents while you wait:

- [hpc](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/hpc/)
- [services](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/services/getting-started/introductory-guide-for-new-hpc-users/)
- [pbs](http://bobcat.nus.edu.sg/hpc/HPC/pbs/index.html)

There is one main queue you can use for single-processor jobs: serial. There are several other types of queues but we will not be able to cover them in this module.
