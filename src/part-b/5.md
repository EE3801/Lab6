# Part 5. Request NUS HPC account

## 25.
Apply for an account [here](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/services/hpc/getting-started-hpc/register-for-hpc/) (you will need to be on the NUS network or use WebVPN)

You can enter the following responses when prompted:

> **Course Name**: EE3801
> 
> **Reason for using HPC resources**: To process large data sets in parallel
> 
> **Research Objective**: To learn how to use PBS to submit jobs to the HPC queues

It might take a few minutes for you to receive an email stating that your request has been approved, so you might want to read through these documents while you wait:

- [hpc](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/hpc/)
- [services](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/services/getting-started/introductory-guide-for-new-hpc-users/)
- [pbs](http://bobcat.nus.edu.sg/hpc/HPC/pbs/index.html)

There are two main queues you can use for single-processor jobs: serial and short. There are several other types of queues but we will not be able to cover them in this module.
